Team_Castaing_Water_Quality_Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes water quality data to determine trends, visualize parameters, and assess potability. Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project preprocesses raw data, explores statistical relationships, and generates insightful visualizations.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and normalizes data.
Statistical Analysis: Provides descriptive statistics and computes correlations between parameters.
Visualization: Creates scatter plots, histograms, and line charts to explore relationships and trends.
Potability Analysis: Assesses water quality for potability (safe or unsafe to drink).
Technologies Used

Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Dataset

The project uses a water quality dataset with the following columns:

pH: Acidity of the water.
Hardness: Level of hardness in the water.
Solids: Amount of dissolved solids in water.
Chloramines: Level of chloramines.
Sulfate: Concentration of sulfate.
Conductivity: Water's electrical conductivity.
Organic_carbon: Organic carbon level.
Trihalomethanes: Concentration of trihalomethanes.
Turbidity: Clarity of the water.
Potability: Indicates if water is potable (1) or not potable (0).
Sample Dataset File
water_quality_data.csv (Ensure this file is in the project directory).

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Install dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Running the Script
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-quality-analysis.git
cd water-quality-analysis
Place your dataset (water_quality_data.csv) in the project folder.
Run the script:
python water_analysis.py
Results

Processed data is saved as processed_water_quality_data.csv.
Visualizations include:
Scatter plots for pH vs. Turbidity.
Histograms for parameters like Dissolved Oxygen or Organic Carbon.
Line charts for time-based analysis (if applicable).
